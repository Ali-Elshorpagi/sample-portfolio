# Sample Portfolio

Mini, responsive portfolio landing page built with semantic HTML, custom CSS, and a small JS toggle for the mobile nav.

## Design

[Figma – Personal Portfolio Template](https://www.figma.com/design/8wAzqNMJiyFYEpQC8TqE8M/%F0%9F%8E%A8-Personal-Portfolio-Template--Community-?node-id=0-1&p=f)

## Preview
- Sections: hero, worked-with logos, case studies, testimonials, recent work, and a contact form.
- Responsive: collapses nav into a toggle and stacks grids on smaller screens.

## Run Locally
1) Clone or download this folder.
2) Open index.html in your browser (no build step needed).

## Customize
- Update text and links in [index.html](index.html).
- Swap images under [assets/](assets/) and match filenames in the HTML.
- Tweak styling in [styles.css](styles.css); mobile rules live under the `@media (max-width: 768px)` block.

## Credits
Icons and placeholder images live in the assets folder; replace with your own before going live.
